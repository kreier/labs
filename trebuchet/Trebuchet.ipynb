It is calculated from the mass $m_1=50 \\text{g}$ of the counterweight, the gravitational acceleration $g=9.81 \\text{ms}^{-2}$ and the difference in height $h=0.28 \\text{m}$ of the counterweight before/after the launch. The formula is\n",

    "If our projectile leaves the catapult or trebuchet at the height of the axle and follows an ideal [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion) (no air resistance) then we can calculate the maximum distance it will travel until it hits the ground. For simplicity we also assume an angle of 45°. There are several online tools to calculate the distance like for example https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/range-projectile-motion. Details are described in the [Article on the range of a projectile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_a_projectile). Using python we can calculate the distance $d$ here in this notebook as well. First we can calculate the time to reach the ground by investigating the vertical motion. Because of the acceleration due to gravitation it is a quadratic formula with the solution:\n",
