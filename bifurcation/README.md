# Bifurcations

While trying Mathematica on the Raspberry Pi 4 I noticed the performance improvements. Since a calculation of a bifurcation was the screenshot for the wikipedia page I tried to replicate the output. I was looking for this:

But the 40 seconds didn't compute for my little ARM CPU. I tried Anaconda as well These are the results by language:

## Mathematica

I tried to copy this code, but the CPU run hot to 85 Â°C on all 4 cores. And several minutes later it produced error messages, but no graph. Like this 

*(kernel 2)* __Set::write:__ `Tag Times in (logistic (Drop[#1,10000]&))[{0.6586014743446188, logistic[3.5228,0.6586014743446188], logistic[3.5228,logistic[3.5228,0.6586014743446188]], <<46>>, logistic[3.5228,logistic[3.5228,logistic[3.5228, logistic[3.5228,logistic[3.5228,logistic[<<2>>]]]]]],<<10050>>}] is Protected.`

That's the code. We went to `Initial k: 10000`

``` mathematica
bifurcate[f_, a0_, k0_, k_, while_: (True &)] := 
  NestWhileList[f, a0, while, 2, k0 + k - 1] // 
    Drop[#, k0] & logistic = {r, y} -> ry (1 - y);

Row@{"Inital value: ", a0 = RandomReal[{0.1, 0.9}]}
Row@{"Points per r: ", density = 10^2}
Row@{"Inital k: ", k0 = 10^4}
Row@{"Time taken: ", 
  Timing[plotdata = 
      ParallelTable[{ConstantArray[r, density], 
          bifurcate[logistic[r, #] &, a0, k0, density]}^T, {r, 3.5, 
         4, 0.0001}] // Flatten[#, 1] &; ][[1]], " s"}
Row@{"Data length: ", plotData // Length}
ListPlot[plotData, PlotStyle -> {Pointsize[0], Opacity[0.1]}, 
 ImageSize -> 800, PlotRange -> {All, {0, 1}}; LabelStyle -> 16]
```

    for r in r_range:
