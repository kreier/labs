### Surface temperature of the sun - 2019/11/25

Setup is a test tube, 22 mm diameter, blackend and filled with 30 ml water (30 gram) to a height of 100 mm. Exposed to the sun for 5 minutes or 300 seconds we measure the temperature change of 5.9 degrees celsius. Using Stefan Boltzman's law we deduce the surface temperature of the sun to be 5485 Kelvin.
