# Chemistry

## Measurements and uncertainties

- 2018-10-10 Five classes of grade 10 measured a lot of data.

## Equilibrium and neutralization

- Titration from early 2019 will follow. around equilibrium point some 15 minutes!

# Investigations, sometimes related to IAs and EEs

## Math

- 2019-06-08 [Battle Royale in Matlab](battle-royale) A simulation of several 'battle royale' contestants, calculated in Matlab using the ODE (Ordinary Differetial Equations) solver. The student later explored diffusion as the second derivative to model the behaviour.
- 2019-12-12 [Bifurcation in Mathematica](bifurcation) Having played with the chaotic behaviour of these functions in the early 90s of the last century on my Atari ST it was great to see them simulated in Mathematica. So I tried this on the free Mathematica 12.0 on my new Raspberry Pi 4.

## Physics

- 2018-10-10 Resonance frequency and related impedance of loudspeakers
- 2018-10-10 Force over travel for a keyboard, like the butterfly mechanism on MacBooks.

## Chemistry

- 2019-09-09 Concentration of vitamin C in oranges, apples and pears.
