# Spectrogram - visualize frequency and amplitude over time

With more capable browsers, laptops and html5 APIs many of Audacity's functionality can be achieved directly in the browser without any installation. Some good visual examples:

For the [first Spectrogram](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Spectrogram/) I have some example files to upload into the browser. For example ...

## Application

2019/11/26 homework

In application of waves we'll have a sneak peek into standing waves (topic 4.5) for an open end tube (straw) to determine the speed of sound.

First I wanted to use the software Audacity. Feel free do download it and install it. But then I realized how many capabilities are in  html5 and that a lot of this was programmed for the browser! I tried several of the following experiments on my smartphone as well. Great visualization and insight. What's your favorite? Can you find other examples? And can you determine the speed of sound?
