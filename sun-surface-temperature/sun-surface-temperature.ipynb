    "# Determination of suns surface temperature with an experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We try to investigate the temperature of the sun's surface by measuring the temperature change of a water filled and blacked test tube when exposed to the sun for a certain time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical background\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the suns surface temperature in this experiment we need four relations. First, we will use the Stefan–Boltzmann-law\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P=e\\sigma AT^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the power $P$ is defined by the emissivity $e$ (equal to 1 for the sun since it is an almost perfect black body), the Stefan–Boltzmann constant $\\sigma = 5.670373 \\times 10^{-8} Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$ and the temperature $T$ in Kelvin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second is the intensity of radiation $I$ defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I=\\frac{P}{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the power $P$ (here the sun) and the illuminated or radiating area $A$. For the latter we have to compare the area of the sun's surface to the area occupied by a sphere with the radius of one AU - Astronomical Unit or mean distance between earth and sun. Since the distance is far greater and the same power is radiated into this much larger area, the intensity is much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the irridated and absorbed power $P$ here on earth we measure the change in internal energy $Q$ over time $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P=\\frac{Q}{t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Last we have to determinte the change in internal energy $Q$. This follows the relation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q=mc\\Delta T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the mass $m$ of the heated water, the specific heat capacity $c=4.184 Jg^{-1}K^{-1}$ of water and the temperature change $\\Delta T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We placed a test tube with $22 mm$ diameter into the sun. Filled with $30 ml$ water the filled height was $100 mm$. The illuminated area can therefore be estimated as a rectangular with the length of $100 mm$ and width of $22 mm$. Note that you don't calculate the surface area of the test tube, which would be close to a cylinder. Only half of that area is irradiated by the sun. And this 50% area is not evenly illuminated, since the angle to the sun is changing around the cylinder. The effective illuminated area can be seen in the shadow - nearly a rectangle.\n",
