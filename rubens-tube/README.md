# Rubens' tube

We have a 2.5 meter steel tube at AISVN to demonstrate the effects of a standing wave with sound and music. I've been using it since 2019 for demonstration purposes and students in grade 8 and 9 calculated the speed of sound in the tube in 2019 and 2020.

### Data collection

So far I have the data from 2019. 2020 will be updated (science 9C and 9E).
