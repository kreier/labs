# Speed of sound

`2019/11/26`

We're going to use a straw, a ruler and our laptop or phone to measure the speed of sound. The notebook at Anaconda documents the steps, we have a local copy as well.

More text from the email to students on November 22nd:

In application of waves we'll have a sneak peek into standing waves (topic 4.5) for an open end tube (straw) to determine the speed of sound.

First I wanted to use the software Audacity. Feel free do download it and install it. But then I realized how many capabilities are in  html5 and that a lot of this was programmed for the browser! I tried several of the following experiments on my smartphone as well. Great visualization and insight. What's your favorite? Can you find other examples? And can you determine the speed of sound?

$$c=\frac{\lambda}{T}=\lambda f$$

Inline rendering does not work yet.

```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
