This can be done in the browser. Some examples:\n\nThe relationship is pretty simpe:\n\n$$c=\\frac{\\lambda}{T}=\\lambda f$$\n\nIn the straw we get a standing wave. Since both ends are open the first node would have a node in the center of the tube and \n\nRegrading the length $l$ of the tube we get the relationship\n\n$$l=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$$\n\nNow measuring the lenth and the frequency of the pitch we can calculate the speed of sound $c$ in air."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"l = float(input(\" Please enter the length of the straw in meter: \"))\nf = float(input(\" Please enter the frequency of the pitch in Hertz: \"))\n\nlambd = 2 * l\nc = lambd * f\n\nprint(str(c) + \" m/s is the speed of sound in the air in Ho Chi Minh\")","execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":" Please enter the length of the straw in meter: .213\n Please enter the frequency of the pitch in Hertz: 3124\n1330.824 is the speed of sound in the air in Ho Chi Minh\n"}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
